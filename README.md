## Oblectives
### Develop a program in Python that pairs a group of anagrams from a given file.

---

## Setting up the environment
Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) IDLE.  
After that check the version with this code :
```bash
python --version
```
Now we create a virtual environment so we can run the code.  

### 1. Creating the environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
### 2. Activating the environment:
#### For Mac/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### For Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3. Installing all the necessary libraries to run the project:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Go to the program directory:
```bash
cd Code
```
### 5. Running the program
```bash
python anagram.py
```
or
```bash
python3 anagram.py
```
### 6. Closing the environment:
```bash
deactivate
```
